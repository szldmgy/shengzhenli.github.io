# Zhenli Sheng (盛镇醴）

I got my bachelor degree in math from University of Science and Technoly of China (USTC) in 2010 and then the Ph.D Degree in computational mathematics (major in nonlinar optimization) in Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in 2015, under the supervisor of Prof. Yaxiang Yuan (http://lsec.cc.ac.cn/~yyx/index.html). I joined Huawei after the graduation. 

I am currently a technical expert and team leader in Huawei Cloud. I mainly work on intesection of AI and OR, including algorithm design, algorithm framework and its application in Huawei and beyond. To be specific, I am now intertesed in time series forcasting and anomaly detection, combinatorial optimization and meta-heuristic algorithms and its application in industrial scenarios. In the past, I worked in large-scale SDN routing in networks, video indexing with extreme efficiency within Huawei. I founded MindSpore (deep learning framework, 昇思 in Chinese) and Optverse (mathematical solver in LP and MILP etc., 天筹求解器 in Chinese). I was the manager and algorithm architect of two commercial products in intelligent transport: Smart Airport and TrafficGo. 

# Recruiting
